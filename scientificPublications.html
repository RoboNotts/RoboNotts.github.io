        <div class="pubIntro">As the large majority of the team is composed of Undergraduate students, these
            members are not actively in research. However, the team also provides a test
            bed for PhD students to use the platforms we build to perform research. The
            RoboNotts team is interested in assisting the following research areas:
            <ul class="bulletP">
                <li>Robotic Safety</li>
                <li>Object Detection</li>
                <li>Human-Robot Interaction</li>
